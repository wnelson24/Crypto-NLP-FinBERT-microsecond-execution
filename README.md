# Crypto-NLP-FinBERT-microsecond-execution

Overview
This Python-based system ingests live crypto news headlines from multiple RSS feeds, applies natural language processing (NLP) to score sentiment in real time, and simulates trades based on those signals.
It is designed for low-latency market reaction, with the ability to process, score, and trade within milliseconds of a headline appearing.

Key features:

Live polling of multiple reputable crypto news sources
Sentiment classification using FinBERT (finance-tuned BERT model)
Configurable position sizing and trade holding periods
One trade per ticker at a time to prevent overexposure
Human-readable terminal output with timestamps and structured columns
Skips stale news â€” only fresh headlines are eligible for trading
